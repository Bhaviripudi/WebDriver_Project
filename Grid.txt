Selenium Grid:
--------------
Grid is a component of selenium used for executing test cases remotely.
It will follow:
Hub(Master) -> Local system(single)
Node(Slave)  -> VMs(Mult) 

Pre-requisites:
----------------
1.We should have all browsers & browser drivers in local and remote machines.
2.We need to make local machine as hub server and VMs as a nodes(register vth hub).
 Download senlenium grid jar in both hub and nodes.
3.Write test case and then execute remote systems.

windows(Hub) ---------> windows(chrome)
windows(Hub) ---------> linux(firefox)

Adv:
----
It allows testcases run parallel therby saving test execution time
Multi browser testing is possible using grid by running the test on machines having diff browsers
It allows multi platform testing by configuring nodes having diff OSs.

Steps:
------
->In cmd where jar located execute this command as a hub
  java -jar selenium-server-4.10.0.jar -role hub
->Nodes should register to http://192.168.55.104/grid/register/
  Clients should connect to http://192.168.55.104/wd/hub
->Check hub is running or not
  http://localhost:4444/grid/console
->Register node command in remote machine
 java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver="D:\\chromedriver.exe" -jar selenium-server-4.10.0.jar -role node -hub http://192.168.55.104/grid/register/

Git and Git Hub:
----------------
Configuration management process: 
Test plan , test cases etc will be shared across team- config management process.
Configuration management tools:
-------------------------------
Git-> Configuration management tool, called as local repository.
Git Hub ->  Is website , where we can maintain all our data or files, called as remote repository.

GitHub account -> Account
create repository 
Git hub account -> Username - Bhaviripudi, Password : Git@sulu98
remote repo link - https://github.com/Bhaviripudi/AutomationS3.git

Git installation -> https://git-scm.com/download/win/

Git commands:
------------
git init -> Initializing local repo
git remote add origin "remote repo link" -> will integrate local repo to remote repo
git pull origin master -> pull files from remote repo
git add <file> -> single file
git add -a   -> mult files 
Begore commiting need to execute 2 user commands for the first time
git config --global user.name "Bhaviripudi"
git config --global user.email sulochanabhav@gmail.com

git commit -> single file
git commit -a -m "commiting"    -> mult files  into local repo
git log

Git with eclipse:
-----------------
->Open Git perspective
->Click on existing repository and select folder which u want to commmit changes, If u alrdy have remote repository.
->Clk on create or clone repository to to add the folder. And give remote url
->Rt clk on ur prjct -> team -> share -> select repository (frst time)/ select commit.

Continuous Integration:
-----------------------
->Once the code is pushed to the git repo, the devops team will integrate and create build and run the build.Once the build is successful, 
  inform to the developers/automation testers
  Tools-> Jenkins, Maven ,Ant etc

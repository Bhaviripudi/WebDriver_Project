Selenium Grid:
--------------
Grid is a component of selenium used for executing test cases remotely.
It will follow:
Hub(Master) -> Local system(single)
Node(Slave)  -> VMs(Mult) 

Pre-requisites:
----------------
1.We should have all browsers & browser drivers in local and remote machines.
2.We need to make local machine as hub server and VMs as a nodes(register vth hub).
 Download senlenium grid jar in both hub and nodes.
3.Write test case and then execute remote systems.

windows(Hub) ---------> windows(chrome)
windows(Hub) ---------> linux(firefox)

Steps:
------
->In cmd where jar located execute this command as a hub
  java -jar selenium-server-4.10.0.jar -role hub
->Nodes should register to http://192.168.55.104/grid/register/
  Clients should connect to http://192.168.55.104/wd/hub
->Check hu is running or not
  http://localhost:4444/grid/console
->Register node command in remote machine
 java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver="D:\\chromedriver.exe" -jar selenium-server-4.10.0.jar -role node -hub http://192.168.55.104/grid/register/

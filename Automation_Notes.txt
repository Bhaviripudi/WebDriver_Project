->Selenium IDE : plug-in for firefox browser, record and playback tool
->Rc(Remote Control) : Is a server will interact with browser and execute automating test cases(indirect). It supports all browsers. Relies on javaScript for

Selenium 1 : IDE, RC, Grid
Selenium 2 : IDE,WebDriver, Grid
Selenium 3 : WebDriver, Grid

Advantages:
------------
->Open source
->It can supports mult labguages(Java,python,c#,Ruby...etc)
->It can also supports mult operating systems
->It also supports mult browsers(Cross Browser Testing)
->Supports parallel testing
->It can integrate third party tools(TestNG, Cucumber, Maven, Jenkins, Git & Git hub)

Disadvantages/Limitations:
--------------------------
->It does not support desktop applications, only for web based applications. -> AutoIt,Sikuli
->Dont have any dedicated support -> Online forums available

when do we take automation:
---------------------------
-> Choose some of the manual test cases(Retest and Regression)
-> Application should be stable

Functional Testing in automation:
---------------------------------
Object properties(Radio button, dropdown,links)
